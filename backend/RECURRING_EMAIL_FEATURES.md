## ðŸ”„ How Recurring Invoices Work

### Automatic Generation
When an invoice with `recurring.isRecurring: true` is marked as "Paid":

1. **Check Conditions**: Verify if recurring should continue
2. **Calculate Next Date**: Based on frequency (weekly, monthly, yearly, custom)
3. **Generate Invoice**: Create new invoice with incremented count
4. **Send Email**: Automatically notify client about new recurring invoice
5. **Link Chain**: Maintain parent-child relationship between invoices

### Frequency Types
- **Weekly**: Every 7 days
- **Monthly**: Every 30 days (approximate)
- **Yearly**: Every 365 days (approximate)
- **Custom**: User-defined number of days

### End Conditions
- **Invoice Count**: Stop after X invoices
- **End Date**: Stop after specific date

## ðŸ“§ Email Templates

### 1. Recurring Invoice Email (`recurring-invoice.ejs`)
- **Purpose**: Notify clients about automatically generated recurring invoices
- **Content**: 
  - Recurring subscription information
  - Invoice details and payment options
  - Subscription management notes
  - Professional branding and styling

### 2. Overdue Reminder Email (`overdue-reminder.ejs`)
- **Purpose**: Urgent reminders for overdue payments
- **Content**:
  - Overdue notice with days overdue
  - Payment consequences and urgency
  - Multiple payment options
  - Support contact information

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Test Commands
```bash
# Test basic email system
npm run test:email

# Test recurring invoice emails
npm run test:recurring

# Test both systems
npm run test:email && npm run test:recurring
```

### Test Scenarios
1. **Recurring Invoice Email**: Monthly subscription notification
2. **Overdue Reminder**: 15-day overdue payment reminder
3. **Missing Email Handling**: Graceful fallback when no client email
4. **Template Rendering**: Professional email appearance

## ðŸ”§ Integration Points

### 1. Invoice Creation
```javascript
// When creating an invoice with recurring settings
const invoice = await Invoice.create({
  // ... other fields
  recurring: {
    isRecurring: true,
    frequency: { type: "monthly" },
    currentCount: 1,
    endCondition: { type: "invoiceCount", value: 12 }
  }
});

// Email is automatically sent to client
await sendInvoiceMail(invoice, creatorInfo);
```

### 2. Payment Processing
```javascript
// When payment is received
if (invoice.invoiceStatus === "Paid" && invoice.recurring?.isRecurring) {
  // Automatically generate next recurring invoice
  const nextInvoice = await generateNextRecurringInvoice(invoice);
  
  // Email is automatically sent to client
  // (handled within generateNextRecurringInvoice)
}
```

### 3. Bulk Operations
```javascript
// Generate all due recurring invoices
const result = await generateRecurringInvoices(req, res);

// Send all overdue reminders
const reminders = await sendOverdueReminders(req, res);
```

## ðŸ“Š Data Flow

```
Invoice Created â†’ Client Email Sent
       â†“
Payment Received â†’ Status Updated
       â†“
